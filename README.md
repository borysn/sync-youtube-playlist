# sync-youtube-playlist

I use youtube for music a lot. Putting together playlists, then using youtube-dl to download and extract mp3 files.
Sometimes these playlists change. This script syncs local files. Deleting locally stored items removed from the youtube playlist, and downloading any new items.

## usage

`npm run script ~/home/p3pt/music/PLAYLISTNAME https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=ID`
